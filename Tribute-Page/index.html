      <h2 id="headline">Tyrion Lannister, also referred to as "the Imp" or "the Halfman" and, while in exile, by the alias Hugor Hill, is a fictional character in the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire series</i></h2>
      <p>He is a prominent point of view character in the novels. Based on an idea that came to Martin while writing the 1981 novel Windhaven, Tyrion has been called <b>one of the author's finest creations and most popular characters</b> by The New York Times. George R.R. Martin has named the character as his favorite in the series.</p>
      <p>Introduced in <i>A Game of Thrones (1996)</i> and subsequently in <i>A Clash of Kings (1998)</i> and <i>A Storm of Swords (2000)</i>, Tyrion was one of a few prominent characters that were not included in <i>A Feast for Crows (2005)</i> but returned in the next novel <i>A Dance with Dragons (2011)</i>. The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume <i>The Winds of Winter</i>. The popularity of the character led Martin and Bantam Books to publish The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister, an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels, in 2013.</p>
      <p><b>Tyrion is a dwarf and member of House Lannister of Casterly Rock</b>, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional continent of Westeros. In the story, Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is sent by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing, as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without the Lannister resources.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>So while we were writing the books we thought about a dwarf who would have been the Lord of one of the islands. He had to be the ugliest person in the world but the most intelligent too. I kept that idea in my mind and it reappeared to me when I was starting to write Game of Thrones. So ... That's Tyrion Lannister.<h3>
